# Biopharma Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains data science projects inspired by real-world biopharma analytical assays.  
All datasets are **synthetic** and generated to reflect realistic assay behavior and variability.

## Projects

### 1. qPCR / ddPCR Assay Control Trending
- Trend analysis of assay controls over time
- Detection of drift, outliers, and run failures
- Control charting and decision logic

### 2. Residual DNA Quantification (qPCR / ddPCR)
- Calculation of residual DNA per dose
- Handling of dilutions, replicates, and uncertainty
- Regulatory-style threshold evaluation

### 3. Multiplex qPCR Panel Performance
- Evaluation of multiplex assay performance
- Threshold optimization
- Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC analysis

## Tools & Skills
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Statistics & time-series analysis
- Data visualization
- Biopharma assay analytics

## Notes
This work reflects my experience as a vaccine R&D scientist transitioning into biopharma data science.
